# Blast
Weird encoders that I've created.

The output for these encodings are indeterministic, while the decoding output is deterministic. There are many encoded outputs for one input, but always the same decoded output for inputs. 

## Building

Run `dotnet build`. This creates a folder named `src/nupkg` with the Nuget package.

Then, run `dotnet tool update -g blast --add-source src/nupkg` from the root of the project. This will install/update the tool as a global tool.

You can now run `blast` in your terminal. Run `blast -h` for help.

## Examples

### Compass Deep Encoder (cdeep)

file.txt:

```
ur mom goes to college
```

Input:

`blast encode -f file.txt -t cdeep`

Output:

file.blst:

```

```

### Insert Encoder (insert)

file.txt:

```
ur mom goes to college
```

Input:

`blast encode -f file.txt -t cdeep`

Output:

file.blst:

```
